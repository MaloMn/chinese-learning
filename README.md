Finding out a way to properly learn Chinese
Based on: audios of native speakers, characters (and stroke orders), pin-yin, english meaning

## Functionalities
1. Learning should happen via:  
    - listening to spoken chinese
    - seeing chinese characters
    - writing chinese characters in stroke order
    - seeing english translation 
    - seeing pin-yin transcription
    - *(not considered yet)* speaking chinese

2. Characters should be learned with increasing difficulty.
   - Meaning single characters should be learned first 
   - Sentences should be learned once most vocabulary has been seen in that particular sentence

3. User should be able to specify if he/she does not want to write characters for instance
4. Most parameters should be configurable
5. Users should be able to enrich the database (pending admin reviews)
6. Users should be able to see the progress of their learning
